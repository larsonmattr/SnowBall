*** Project SnowBall ***

This is a tinkering project of a simple VR ski game.

* It requires Unity 2017.2.1 and a Windows Mixed Reality Headset
* Optionally, uses Unity Store Asset packs (import with default location):
- Korea native trees ( see asset korea-native-trees-7714 )

* VR driven by Mixed Reality Toolkit for Camera scripts
* Terrain built in L3DT and imported into Unity for additional changes
* Mixed Reality Toolkit is included in this repository
* Ski controller drives player movements via Unity Physics
* Ski poles (hand controllers) are simple trigger to accelerate player. 

Originally, it also used the "Winter Ground Pack", but this has been replaced
for demonstration with some free snow textures from CGTextures.com.

SkyBox texture is sky texture with a 360 mountain panorama, and will be
substituted with a higher quality skybox image.
